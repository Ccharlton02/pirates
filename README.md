    <h3>Videos explaining how to set up libGDX, tilesets and a tilemap</h3>
    <p>Worth probably just skimming through, as long as a few of us know how to implement it</p>

    <h3>Downloads</h3>
    <p>To use libGDX for some reason it requried us to use java 15 so you need to downgrade your java (bruh), also we need to download tiled to make the tilemaps, and download git so we can clone the files on the repository if you haven't yet</p>

        <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git download</a>

        <br>If you already have a newer version of Java, search "configure java" in Windows, go to the 'java' section, view the versions, press 'find' and head in to your program files and select the java directory. It will find it and then you can select that version and deselect the others<br>
        This took so much pain to figure out for some reason
